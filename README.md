Hi! Welcome to my visual argument piece, "embrace". It's definitely a work in progress, but the basic idea is to encourage open-mindedness when listening to music. I strongly believe that good music is simply good music, regardless of genre, and that preferences (i.e. a lot of the genres one supposedly "doesn't like") are often indicative of prejudice, misconception, and racism. Let me know what you think and what I can improve on!
