Hi! Welcome to my visual argument piece, "embrace". As a musician and avid music fan, I believe that a well-balanced music diet can not only lead to improving your ear, but also to better understanding other people and cultures other than your own. I've included some artists who I think either break down these barriers, or others (*cough cough* Don Henley) who seek to act as gatekeepers and keep them in place. Please enjoy the final (for now) rendition of my piece, "embrace"!
